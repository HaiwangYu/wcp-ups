     * A Tiling defines a number of "cells" which completely fill a
     * region of 2D space.  These cells are expected to be related to
     * a number of sets of parallel wires.  Each set of parallel wires
     * fall into one of three wire planes called U, V and Y.  Y wire
     * planes run parallel to the Y-axis.  U and V wires are at some
     * angle w.r.t. the Y-axis.
     *
     * The methods of the Tiling expose relationships between a cell
     * and the associated wires.
